# Web-GBA-Emulator
This is a web emulator that allows you to play any "GameBoy Advance" game. You simply have to upload the game rom. You can save your games and upload them to maintain your progress. It has an adaptive design for all types of devices.


The emulator has not been programmed by me. I have only adapted the emulator for the web, in addition to also adapting the gameboy made with pure CSS since the gameboy advanced does not have that screen resolution. So much of the credit belongs to the authors.
